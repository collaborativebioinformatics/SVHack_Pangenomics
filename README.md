# SVHack_Pangenomics

## Intro
- In large-scale population genomics research, the single standard reference genome model has inherent limitations, especially in the fields of human genomic analysis. Pan-Genome Research Tool Kit (PGR-TK) enabling analyses of complex pangenome structural and haplotype variation at multiple scales, which provides detailed structure and analysis on complex genomic regions which couldnâ€™t be analyzed before.

- We are aimed to construct a database of high variation risk regions in human genomic sequences with corresponding indexes.
